# Binary Hybrid Cuckoo Search Equilibrium Optimizer (CSEO) Algorithm for Cryptanalysis of Internal State of Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4)

Objectives

The main objective of the study is to assess the performance of Binary Hybrid CSEO  Algorithm for attacking the Internal State of RC4 Cipher. Specifically, the study 
seeks to answer the following questions: 

- What is the performance of the proposed BHCSEO in terms of: Best Fitness, Worst Fitness, Average, Standard Deviation, Time, and Memory Usage with  the following population sizes: 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100? 
- What is the efficiency of BHCSEO compared with the binary hybrid that uses  Particle Swarm Optimization and Equilibrium Optimizer (Rizk-Allah et al.,2022) in terms of: Best Fitness, Worst Fitness, Average, Standard Deviation, and Time with the following population sizes: 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100?
