Purpose : 
- To show the performance of the proposed BHCSEO in terms of: Best Fitness, Worst Fitness, Average, Standard Deviation, Time, and Memory Usage with the following population sizes: 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100.
- To show efficiency of BHCSEO compared with the binary hybrid that uses Particle Swarm Optimization and Equilibrium Optimizer (Rizk-Allah et al.,2022) in terms of: Best Fitness, Worst Fitness, Average, Standard Deviation,and Time with the following population sizes: 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100
