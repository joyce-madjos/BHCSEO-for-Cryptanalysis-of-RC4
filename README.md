## Purpose:
- To show the performance of the proposed BHCSEO in terms of: Best Fitness, Worst Fitness, Average, Standard Deviation, Time, and Memory Usage with the following population sizes: 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100.
- To show efficiency of BHCSEO compared with the binary hybrid that uses Particle Swarm Optimization and Equilibrium Optimizer (Rizk-Allah et al.,2022) in terms of: Best Fitness, Worst Fitness, Average, Standard Deviation,and Time with the following population sizes: 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100         

## Background:
In today's world, information drives practically every area of human existence, not 
just in business. And as the use of remote working, hybrid workplaces, and 
digitalization grows in 2022, these technological tendencies expand, so does the 
amount of data being produced; hence, the growing risk of cyberattacks. And 
currently, one of the increasing cyberattack prevention methods is the 
cryptographic attack called cryptanalysis. Using an integration of two algorithms, 
the researchers aim to contribute further to the current growing cyberattack 
prevention methods. The main goal of this research is to hybridize Cuckoo Search 
Algorithm and Equilibrium Optimizer to attack the internal state of RC4 cipher.
